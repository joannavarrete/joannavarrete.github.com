<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Variables and Constants <strong>(1.1)</strong></p>
<p>A <em>variable</em> is a letter or symbol that represents any member of a
collection of two or more numbers. A <em>constant</em> is a letter or
symbol that represents a specific number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Binary Operation <strong>(1.1)</strong></p>
<p>A <em>binary operation</em> is a process that assigns two numbers to a
single number. +, -, <mathjax>$\times, \div$</mathjax>, are binary operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grouping Symbols <strong>(1.1)</strong></p>
<p>Grouping symbols are used to indicate that a particular collection
of numbers and meaningful operations is to be considered as a single
number ( <mathjax>$5 \div 0$</mathjax> is not meaningful). Grouping symbols can also
direct us in operations when more than two operations are to be
performed. Common algebraic grouping symbols are</p>
<p>Parentheses: ( )</p>
<p>Brackets: [ ]</p>
<p>Braces: { }</p>
<p>Bar: —</p>
<p>When two or more operations are to be performed on a collection of
numbers, the correct value can be obtained only by using the correct
order of operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coordinate and Graph <strong>(1.2)</strong></p>
<p>The number associated with a point on the number line is called the
<em>coordinate</em> of the point. The point associated with a number is
called the <em>graph</em> of the number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Real Number <strong>(1.2)</strong></p>
<p>A <em>real number</em> in any number that is the coordinate of a point on
the real number line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Types of Real Numbers <strong>(1.2)</strong></p>
<p>The collection of real numbers has many sub collections. The ones of
most interest to us are</p>
<p>the <em>natural numbers</em>: {1,2,3, ...}</p>
<p>the <em>whole numbers</em>: {0,1,2,3, ...}</p>
<p>the <em>integers</em>: {..., -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3, ...}</p>
<p>the <em>ration numbers</em>: {all numbers that can be expressed as the
quotient of two integers }</p>
<p>the <em>irrational numbers</em>: {all numbers that have nonending and
nonrepeating decimal representations}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Properties of Real Numbers <strong>(1.3)</strong></p>
<p><em>Closure</em>: If a and b are real numbers, then a + b and a <mathjax>$\cdot$</mathjax> b
are unique real numbers.</p>
<p><em>Commutative</em>: <mathjax>$a + b = b + a$</mathjax> and <mathjax>$a \cdot b = b \cdot a$</mathjax></p>
<p><em>Associative</em>: <mathjax>$a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$</mathjax> and
<mathjax>$a(b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b)c$</mathjax></p>
<p><em>Distributive</em>: <mathjax>$a(b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$</mathjax></p>
<p><em>Additive identity</em>: 0 is the additive identity a + 0 = a and 0 + a
= a</p>
<p><em>Multiplicative identity</em>: 1 is the multiplicative identity.
<mathjax>$a \cdot 1 = a$</mathjax> and <mathjax>$1 \cdot a = a$</mathjax></p>
<p><em>Additive inverse</em>: For each real number a there is exactly one
number -a such that <mathjax>$a + (-a) = 0$</mathjax> and <mathjax>$(-a) + a = 0$</mathjax></p>
<p><em>Multiplicative identity</em>: For each nonzero real number a there is
exactly one nonzero real number <mathjax>$\frac1a$</mathjax> such that
<mathjax>$a \cdot \frac1a = 1$</mathjax> and <mathjax>$\frac1a \cdot a = 1$</mathjax>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exponents <strong>(1.4)</strong></p>
<p>Exponents record the number of ientical factors that appear in a
multiplication.</p>
<p><mathjax>$\underbrace{x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x,...,x}_{\text{n factors of x}} = x^n$</mathjax></p>
</li>

<p>Rational Expression <strong>(7.1)</strong></p>
<p>A <em>rational expression</em> is an algebraic expression that can be
written as the quotient of two polynomials. An example of a
rational expression is </p>
<p><mathjax>$$\frac{x^2 + 3x -1}{7x - 4}$$</mathjax></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Domain of a Rational Expression <strong>(7.1)</strong></p>
<p>The <em>domain</em> of a rational expression is the collection of values
for which the rational expression is defined. These values can be
found by determining the values that will not produce zero in the
denominator of the expression. </p>
<p>The domain of <mathjax>$\frac{x + 6}{x + 8}$</mathjax> is the collection of all
numbers except -8.</p>
